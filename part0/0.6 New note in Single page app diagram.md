The following sequence diagram shows what occurs when a user enters a new note into the SPA. 
In contrast to the traditional web application in exercise 0.4, the application does not reload entirely and instead simply makes one POST request to the server.

      participant browser
      participant server
  
      browser->>server: POST https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/new_note_spa
      activate server
      server-->>browser: 201 code
      deactivate server
  
      Note right of browser: The browser adds the note to its array of notes and then renders the new note on the webpage using client side javascript code.
      Note right of browser: Once this is finished the browser then makes a POST request to the server where it sends the note in json format.
```
